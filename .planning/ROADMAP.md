# Roadmap: 3-Body Problem Physics-Inspired LLM

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 Codebase Cleanup** — Phases 1–4 (shipped 2026-03-20; [archive](milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md))
- ✅ **v1.1 LaTeX Modularization Verification** — Phases 5–8 (shipped 2026-03-22)

- ✅ **v1.3 Markdown Conversion Verification & Correction** — Phases 10–15, 15.1 (shipped 2026-05-08; [archive](milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md))
- ✅ **v1.4 Resolving 01 Architecture and Physics Foundations** — Phases 16–22, including 20.5 (shipped 2026-06-09; [roadmap archive](milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md), [requirements archive](milestones/v1.4-REQUIREMENTS.md), [phase archive](milestones/v1.4-phases/))
- ✅ **v1.5 Resolving 02 Data Pipeline and Validation** — Phases 23–29, including 24.5 (shipped 2026-06-17; archived under [`milestones/v1.5-*`](milestones/))
- ✅ **v1.6 Resolving 03 Curriculum and Training Loop** — Phases 30–36 (shipped 2026-07-02; 32/32 requirements, 26/26 acceptance probes PASS, ledger 18/18 VERIFIED; FUT-01/FUT-04 routed to the trainex track; archived under [`milestones/v1.6-*`](milestones/))
- ✅ **v2.0 CTL-PINN Training Viability Slice** — Phases 37–43 (shipped 2026-07-23; the project's first **build** milestone / trainex track — Stage-0-first end-to-end training slice from the ratified trainex-r1a decisions; 42/42 requirements Complete; audit `tech_debt` with zero blockers; the sole held-out physics gate rendered an honest **FAIL** (`ε_H = 237.21` vs ≤ 1e-5) and the owner signed **`adjust`** — Stage-0 mechanical slice retained, PLAT-01..07 blocked, physics-gate investigation routed to the next milestone; archived under [`milestones/v2.0-*`](milestones/))
- ✅ **v2.1 Physics-Gate Investigation & trainex-r2 Research Package** — Phases 44–45 (shipped 2026-07-24; the separately governed investigation routed by the v2.0 `adjust` verdict — read-only forensics over the retained v2.0 artifacts + trainex-r2 ERW package delivery; 7/7 requirements, package audited PASS; a bounded conformance audit found the v2.0 pilot diverged from the locked specs in five verified respects, qualifying the Phase 44 diagnosis and seeding a conformance-first next milestone; archived under [roadmap](milestones/v2.1-ROADMAP.md), [requirements](milestones/v2.1-REQUIREMENTS.md), [gaps](milestones/v2.1-GAPS.md), [phase archive](milestones/v2.1-phases/))
- ⚠️ **v2.2 Stage-0 Conformance Repair & Valid Re-Run** — Phases 46–52 (started 2026-07-25; **closed incomplete 2026-08-17**; repaired all nine verified Stage-0 conformance divergences (Phases 46–49, CONF/INST/GATE/TEST-01..09 Complete) and re-ran Stage-0 under the corrected recipe (Phase 50), but the conformant run HALTed at the invariant-B causal-front gate, step 501 — a bounded 2026-08-17 conformance audit found this is a property of the locked architecture at initialization (SIREN second-derivative scale vs. causal-weight calibration), not a further conformance defect, with no remedy available inside v2.2 (SCOPE-30); owner selected `stop-incomplete` (RUN-01/RUN-02 unsatisfied), the sole held-out evaluation was preserved unspent (RUN-03/EVAL-01 not attempted), and DIAG-05/VER-19/VER-20 were discharged in adapted form (Phase 52); 20/24 requirements Complete, 2 closed incomplete, 2 not attempted; archived under [`milestones/v2.2-*`](milestones/); routes to v2.3)
- ⚠️ **v2.3 Causal-Weight/SIREN-Scale Recipe Adjudication** — Phases 53–58 (started 2026-08-18; **closed 2026-10-04 on the declared terminal state**; codified the four research-free VER-20 items (Phase 53), obtained the owner-delegated recalibration ruling `A1 + B2 + C1 + D3 + E1` through the `trainex-r3` ERW round (Phase 54), landed the architecture characterization probe (Phase 55), and wrote the ruling into `pinn_architecture.md` as a SCOPE-38 contract amendment with the fail-closed train-free gate GATE-04 passing (Phase 56); the Stage-0 re-run (Phase 57) produced no graded result in generations 1–6, and generation-7 graded seed 42 tripped invariant B at step 951 (front stuck at 2 since step 450), so seeds 41/43 were not launched and the sole held-out evaluation stays preserved unspent; owner verdict **`rethink`** (2026-10-03): RUN-04/RUN-05 closed incomplete, EVAL-02 not attempted, Stage-1+/PLAT-01..07 still blocked; 12/15 requirements Complete; archived under [roadmap](milestones/v2.3-ROADMAP.md), [requirements](milestones/v2.3-REQUIREMENTS.md), [gaps](milestones/v2.3-GAPS.md), with the phase folders left in `phases/`; routes to ERW round `trainex-r4`)
- 🔮 **Final Publication LaTeX Sync** — deferred until implementation, network/training design, training, and research-result interpretation are complete

## Deferred: Final Publication LaTeX Sync

**Goal:** Refresh LaTeX/PDF publication sources from the final authoritative markdown framework specs.

**Preconditions:**

- Implementation complete (FUT-01 or successor milestone)
- Network design stable
- Training and research results complete
- No active framework-spec iteration expected

**Non-goal:** Maintaining `.tex` parity during active development milestones.

**Source of truth:** Markdown framework specs (`pinn_instruction/markdown_conversion/framework-specs/*.md`) at final sync start.

**Historical note:** This supersedes the earlier draft `v1.6.5-latex-sync` timing from the May 24, 2026 design document.
